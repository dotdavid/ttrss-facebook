==============

Hi,

I made a Facebook plugin by shamelessly ripping off (er, adapting) homolibere's Google+ plugin (hope he doesn't mind). Thought someone might find it useful...

Notes
-----

1) This uses an API that Facebook want to deprecate, but hey I don't want to spend long pandering to their whims and it works for now.

2) I think you need to update the locale files if you don't want this in English.

3) I literally spent 5 minutes on this, so if it doesn't work that's why.

Changelog
---------

v1.2 - Cleaned up code a bit to bring it into line with the newer plugins. Added discussion link. No functional change.

v1.1 - Compatible with the v2 API. Thanks to Shadok for the code :-)

v1.0 - Initial Release
